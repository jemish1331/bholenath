<b>Preventing Skin Infections</b></br>

<br>What is the most important way to prevent the spread of skin infections?
<ul>

<li>Hand washing (hand hygiene) is the most important way to prevent the spread of skin infections in any setting.

<li>To wash your hands properly:

<li>Wet your hands with clean water and apply soap. Use warm water if it is available.
<li>Rub hands together to make a lather and scrub all surfaces.
<li>Continue rubbing hands for 20 seconds (the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice).
<li>Rinse hands well with clean water.
<li>Dry your hands using a paper towel or air dryer.
<li>If possible, use your paper towel to turn off the faucet.
<li>If soap and water are not available and your hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (60% alcohol or greater) if permitted by your school or athletic club. If alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not allowed or are unavailable, hand sanitizers that do not contain alcohol may also be useful.

<li>To use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer:

<li>Apply product to the palm of one hand.
<li>Rub hands together.
<li>Rub the product over all surfaces of hands and fingers until hands are dry.
</ul>

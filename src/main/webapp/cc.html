Most people get colds in the winter and spring, but it is possible to get a cold any time of the year. Symptoms usually include:
<ul>
<li>sore throat
<li>runny nose
<li>coughing
<li>sneezing
<li>headaches
<li>body aches
</ul><br>
Most people recover within about 7-10 days. However, people with weakened immune systems, asthma, or respiratory conditions may develop serious illness, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.
How to Protect Yourself
Viruses that cause colds can spread from infected people to others through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected through contact with stool (poop) or respiratory secretions from an infected person. This can happen when you shake hands with someone who has a cold, or touch a surface, like a doorknob, that has respiratory viruses on it, then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.

<b>You can help reduce your risk of getting a cold:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Wash your hands often with soap and water.</b><br>
 Wash them for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Viruses that cause colds can live on your hands, and regular handwashing can help protect you from getting sick.
<li><b>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</b><br> Viruses that cause colds can enter your body this way and make you sick
<li><b>Stay away from people who are sick.</b><br> Sick people can spread viruses that cause the common cold through close contact with others.

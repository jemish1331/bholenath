<b>Causes</b>
<br>
Most cases of elbow pain are due to strained or inflamed soft tissues such as tendons or ligaments.

These tend to get better after a few days with simple self-care you can do at home.<br>

Sometimes elbow pain may be caused by a medical condition.<br>

A number of things can cause stiffness in your elbow, including arthritis (arth-rye-tus). Arthritis simply means a joint that is painful and swollen, and there are a number of types of arthritis.<br>

Stiffness can happen due to problems with the elbow joint itself or with the muscles, covering of the joint, or ligaments.<br>

In some situations, such as after an injury or operation, soft tissue can form into scar tissue. This can cause elbow stiffness.<br>

Occasionally, the elbow may lock in a fixed position. This is often short-lived but may be due to a loose bit of bone or cartilage in the joint. The loose fragments may need to be washed out in surgery.<br>

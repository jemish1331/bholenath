Carpel tunnel syndrome is a condition that develops when a ligament thickens and puts pressure on a nerve. The nerve is squeezed, which can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand.

People who are obese or those who have diabetes or arthritis are at an increased risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

The condition is also linked with repetitive work that involves lifting, typing, or using equipment that vibrates the hand.

<b>Osteoarthritis</b>
</br>
Osteoarthritis causes inflammation of the joints and occurs when the cartilage that covers the bones wears away. The condition can affect a wide range of joints, including the wrist. Osteoarthritis of the wrist tends to occur most often in people who are middle age or older, and those with a family history of the condition.
<br>
<b>Rheumatoid arthritis</b><br>
Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease where healthy tissues are broken down by the body’s immune system. This can cause wrist pain if the joints in the area are affected.

<b>
De Quervain’s disease</b>
<br>
In this condition, tendons and their coverings on the thumb side of the wrist become inflamed and swell. The exact cause is not known, but it is often associated with an injury to the area or overuse. Symptoms include a grating feeling inside the wrist, swelling, and weakness along the wrist, forearm, and thumb.

<br>
<b>Repetitive motion syndrome</b>
</br>
As the name suggests, repetitive motion syndrome occurs from repeating a task over and over again, such as typing, or knitting. Overworking the joint can cause it to swell, putting pressure on the surrounding nerves.

It can affect many joints in the body, including the wrist.

<br>
<b>Triangular fibrocartilage complex injury</b>
<br>
The triangular fibrocartilage is located on the pinky side of the wrist. It acts as a cushion and support for the small bones. The cartilage can wear away over time or tear due to an injury.

<br>
<b>Wrist tendonitis</b><br>
Wrist tendonitis can occur when the tendons of the wrist develop small tears or become irritated and inflamed. The condition usually occurs due to repetitive movement involving the wrist.

<br>
<b>Wrist bursitis</b><br>
Bursa are small fluid-filled sacs that help cushion joints. When these become inflamed it is referred to as bursitis. These can occur in many areas of the body, including the wrist. Symptoms include tenderness over the tendons of the wrist, redenss in the region, and swelling.

<br>
<b>Ganglion cyst</b><br>
This cause of wrist pain is due to fluid-filled soft tissue cysts that often develop on the wrist opposite the palm but will occur on the palmar aspect of the wrist. Smaller cysts often tend to hurt more than large cysts.

<br>
<b>Wrist sprain</b><br>
According to the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, a wrist sprain is usually caused by falling and bending the wrist backward when the hand hits the ground. This movement overstretches the ligament.

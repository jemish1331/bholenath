A headache can occur in any part of the head, on both sides of the head, or in just one location.

There are different ways to define headaches.

The International Headache Society (IHS) categorize headaches as primary, when they are not caused by another condition, or secondary, when there is a further underlying cause.
<h3><b><u>Primary headaches</u></b></h3>
Primary headaches are stand-alone illnesses caused directly by the overactivity of, or problems with, structures in the head that are pain-sensitive.

This includes the blood vessels, muscles, and nerves of the head and neck. They may also result from changes in chemical activity in the brain.

Common primary headaches include migraines, cluster headaches, and tension headaches.

<h3><b><u>Secondary headaches</u></b></h3>
Secondary headaches are symptoms that happen when another condition stimulates the pain-sensitive nerves of the head. In other words, the headache symptoms can be attributed to another cause.

A wide range of different factors can cause secondary headaches.
<u>These include:</u><ul type="disc">
<li>alcohol-induced hangover
<li>brain tumor
<li>blood clots
<li>bleeding in or around the brain
<li>brain freeze, or ice-cream headaches
<li>carbon monoxide poisoning
<li>concussion
<li>dehydration
<li>glaucoma
<li>teeth-grinding at night
<li>influenza
<li>overuse of pain medication, known as rebound headaches
<li>panic attacks
<li>stroke
</ul>
As headaches can be a symptom of a serious condition, it is important to seek medical advice if they become more severe, regular, or persistent.

For example, if a headache is more painful and disruptive than previous headaches, worsens, or fails to improve with medication or is accompanied by other symptoms such as confusion, fever, sensory changes, and stiffness in the neck, a doctor should be contacted immediately.

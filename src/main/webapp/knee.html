<b>Causes of knee pain</b><br>
Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sprains, and gout are some of the most common causes of knee pain.
<br>
<b>Osteoarthritis</b><br>
Osteoarthritis is one of the most common causes of long-term knee pain.

One common reason for long-term knee pain is a type of arthritis known as osteoarthritis. It is thought to be caused by wear and tear in the joint. It affects mostly older people over 65 years.

The knee bends and straightens smoothly because of the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones in the healthy joint.

Long-term damage to this cartilage leads to osteoarthritis. Movement becomes restricted and pain gradually increases.

The pain worsens on weight-bearing and is relieved with rest.

Pain also comes on after waking up or following periods without moving.

Movement reduces stiffness.

<b>Rheumatoid arthritis</b></br>
Another kind of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), can cause knee pain, too.

Rheumatoid arthritis tends to involve swelling of the knee. Sore joints will tend to be red, tender, warm, and swollen.

The pain involves more general stiffness that is typically worse in the early morning. There can be afternoon fatigue. Knee pain with these symptoms needs the attention of a doctor for correct diagnosis and treatment. Rheumatoid arthritis benefits from early treatment.

<b>Sprains, strains, and injuries</b>
</br>
Sprains and strains happen when tissues in the knee become stretched by unusual or increased activity, or an awkward twist or trip.

PRICE, described above, should lead to a reduction in pain and improved movement within days, and a gradual improvement over the weeks to follow.

A sprain often resolves itself, but some problems can require more treatment. For example, an injury to the pad of tissue in the knee joint known as the meniscus may require surgery.

<br><b>Gout</b>
<br>
Gout is another type of arthritis. It produces sudden episodes of severe knee pain with redness and swelling, and can affect other joints. The condition can be treated under medical care with medication and changes to diet and exercise.

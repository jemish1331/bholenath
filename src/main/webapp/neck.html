Causes of neck pain</b><br>
Neck pain or stiffness can happen for a variety of reasons.
<br>
<b>Muscle tension and strain</b><br>
This is usually due to activities and behaviors such as:
<ul>
<li>poor posture
<li>working at a desk for too long without changing position
<li>sleeping with your neck in a bad position
<li>jerking your neck during exercise
</ul>
<b>Injury</b><br>

The neck is particularly vulnerable to injury, especially in falls, car accidents, and sports, where the muscles and ligaments of the neck are forced to move outside of their normal range.

If the neck bones (cervical vertebrae) are fractured, the spinal cord may also be damaged. Neck injury due to sudden jerking of the head is commonly called whiplash.

<br><b>Heart attack</b><br>
Neck pain can also be a symptom of a heart attack, but it often presents with other symptoms of a heart attack, such as:
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath
<li>sweating
<li>nausea
<li>vomiting
<li>arm or jaw pain
</ul>
If your neck hurts and you have other symptoms of heart attack, call an ambulance or go to the emergency room immediately.

<br><b>Meningitis</b></br>
Meningitis is an inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. In people who have meningitis, a fever and a headache often occur with a stiff neck. Meningitis can be fatal and is a medical emergency.

If you have the symptoms of meningitis, seek help immediately.

<br><b>Other causes</b><br>
Other causes include the following:
<ul>
<li>Rheumatoid arthritis causes pain, swelling of the joints, and bone spurs. When these occur in the neck area, neck pain can result.
<li>Osteoporosis weakens bones and can lead to small fractures. This condition often happens in hands or knees, but it can also occur in the neck.
<li>Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes muscle pain throughout the body, especially in the neck and shoulder region.
<li>As you age, the cervical discs can degenerate. This is known as spondylosis, or osteoarthritis of the neck. This can narrow the space between the vertebrae. It also adds stress to your joints.
<li>When a disk protrudes, as from a trauma or injury, it may add pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. This is called a herniated cervical disk, also known as a ruptured or slipped disk.
<li>Spinal stenosis occurs when the spinal column narrows and causes pressure on the spinal cord or the nerve roots as it exits the vertebrae. This can be due to long-term inflammation caused by arthritis or other conditions.
</ul>
In rare instances, neck stiffness or pain occurs due to:
<ul>
<li>congenital abnormalities
<li>infections
<li>abscesses
<li>tumors
<li>cancer of the spine
</ul>
